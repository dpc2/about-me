# about-me
### Hello! Welcome to my GitHub.

This is where I'll be storing some of the code I've written, either for work or pleasure. I've got a background in hardware engineering, but I'm currently working as a software test engineer in Denver, CO. I'm hoping that with enough professional experience and personal projects under my belt, I'll learn to be skilled in both realms and contribute to the entire product development process. Oh, and contributing to the open sauce community would be pretty cool too! But one step at a time.

Electronics are amazing, and I'm frequently in awe of the progress we've made since the days of Leyden jars, electrostatic generators, and spark-gap transmitters.

But I think hardware is even more fun when you're writing code to interact with it, so here I am! Analog electronics are great for communicating with the outside world, but digital electronics are arguably even more important, and you don't communicate with them without knowing a programming language or two.
