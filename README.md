# about-me
### Hello! Welcome to my GitHub.

This is where I'll be storing some of the code I've written, either for work or pleasure. I'm a hardware engineer by education, currently working as a software engineer in Denver, CO. I'm hoping that with enough professional experience and personal projects under my belt, I'll learn to be fluent in both realms and be able to contribute to the entire product development process. Oh, and contributing to the open sauce community would be pretty cool too! But one step at a time.
